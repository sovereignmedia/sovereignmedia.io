## The Challenge

Frontieras North America needed to present complex financial data — spanning 9 international markets, 6 product lines, and multiple investment scenarios — in a format that institutional investors could engage with intuitively. Traditional pitch decks and static spreadsheets weren't cutting it.

## The Solution

We designed and developed a comprehensive interactive financial dashboard built to institutional investor standards. The application features real-time scenario modeling, allowing investors to toggle between Conservative, Base, and Aggressive cases and see the numbers update instantly.

### Key Features

- **Real-time scenario modeling** across three investment cases with dynamic financial computations
- **Global market analysis** spanning 9 countries with regulatory environments and market sizing
- **Unit economics breakdown** for 6 distinct product lines
- **Integrated valuation analysis** using DCF, comparable company, and market multiple methodologies
- **Premium visual design** benchmarked against Palantir, Stripe, and Linear

## The Results

The Regulation CF campaign powered by this dashboard and supporting materials generated $4.49M in funding from $904K in spend — a 4.97X blended ROAS. At the top of funnel, we drove $13.85M in value (15.32X ROAS) while saving $581K against the original $1.485M forecast.

## Technical Scope

~1,600 lines of production code in a self-contained React application. 7 major dashboard sections, 12+ interactive charts, and 3 investment scenario models with real-time calculation switching.
